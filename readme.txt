 After installation, click 'Activate Plugin'. Now, to register with backup.rocks, go to https://backup.rocks and then click on 'Sign Up'. A new page up will now appear which will ask you to select a plan. After selecting the plan of your choice (Free or Premium), another page will appear which will ask you for a few registration details, including Email, Password and Site URL. Please use a valid email and a strong password. For the site URL, use the URL of the site that you want to backup or the URL of the site on which you have installed backup plugin on. URL must be complete, for example:-
If your site is example.com, enter the site URL as http://example.com
If your site is www.example.com, use http://www.example.com.
If your site is using SSL, use https://example.com (with or without www, depending on your site URL).
After filling this information click on 'Purchase'. You will then be asked to enter your card details for the purchase (if you have selected one of the premium plans). After a successful payment, it will provide you with a license key and a link to download the plugin. (You don't need to download it again, as you have already done so in above steps.).
